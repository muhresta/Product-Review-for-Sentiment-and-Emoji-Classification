### Natural Language Processing Independent Project.

PRDECT-ID Dataset is a collection of Indonesian product review data annotated with emotion and sentiment labels. The data were collected from one of the giant e-commerce in Indonesia named Tokopedia.

The dataset contains product reviews from 29 product categories on Tokopedia that use the Indonesian language. Each product review is annotated with a single emotion, i.e., love, happiness, anger, fear, or sadness. The group of annotators does the annotation process to provide emotion labels by following the emotions annotation criteria created by an expert in clinical psychology. Other attributes related to the product review are also extracted, such as Location, Price, Overall Rating, Number Sold, Total Review, and Customer Rating, to support further research.

This analysis helps us identify meaningful patterns in society, market, and product sentiment.. The analysis output can be used as a reference for developing consumer-focused marketing strategies and products in Indonesian e-commerce.

Independent project for building my portofolio. This dataset taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jocelyndumlao/prdect-id-indonesian-emotion-classification).
